# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Design Analysis of Algorithms is a course focused on the study of nature through the lens of algorithms. The course emphasises finding solutions to complex problems by observing and understanding the workings of natural elements intuitively and in the way they were developed historically.


We have come across many kinds of data structures such as n-nary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, tries, queries,look-up table, sparse table, skip list, graphs, and many more combined with the study of algorithms such as sequential search, brave and cautious travel, backtracking, sorting techniques (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap), string algorithms (Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp, rolling hash), union/disjoint sets, and shortest path algorithms (Floyd-Warshall, Prim's)


The course assignments and projects are with real-world applications or at least mock-ups of the real-time application, discussing the use of each data structure and algorithm in the real-world scenario discussing its shortcomings and much more. For example, Submission throttling was discussed as a part of trie data structure, We were asked to wisely choose the data structure to build a recommendation engine and a localized, faster user-defined heap memory. The world currently, needs engineers who can build efficient algorithms or optimize the existing algorithms to perform better, This course builds the intuition to build better algorithms and the proper approach to understand the existing ones.
