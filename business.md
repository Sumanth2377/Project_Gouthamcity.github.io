            <h2>Waste Segregation and Collection</h2>
            <p>Goutham emphasizes waste segregation and collection. There's an opportunity to offer advanced recycling services or solutions for efficient waste disposal. Growing Urban Need: Rapid urbanization increases waste production. A structured recycling and waste management service can address this problem effectively. Government and Citizen Support: we can collaborate with local authorities, receive grants, and charge fees for organized waste collection and recycling. Revenue from Recycled Products: Recycled materials (plastic, paper, metals, compost) can be sold to manufacturers or directly to consumers.
            
            
a) Dijkstra's Algorithm (Route Optimization)

Dijkstra's Algorithm is widely used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is particularly effective for optimizing routes, such as in waste collection services, where traveling time can be reduced and fuel consumption can be reduced.

Time Complexity: O(E log V)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Use Case: Finding closest collection routes

Pros:
Efficient Path Calculation: Ensures the shortest path, minimizing fuel costs and travel time, which is crucial for daily waste collection routes.
Works effectively for large urban areas with a well-structured road network.
Integration with GPS: Easily integrates with modern navigation systems to provide real-time route optimization.

Cons:
Limited to Non-Negative Weights: The algorithm does not handle scenarios where road weights (distances or costs) may change dynamically to negative.
High Computational Demand: In dense urban networks, it may require significant computational resources.(Like there is more waste to be collected in specific area and they need to load twice)
Not well-suited for real-time dynamic updates, like sudden roadblocks or traffic changes.

b) QuickSort (Waste Segregation)

Time Complexity: O(n log n) average case
Space Complexity: O(log n)
Use Case: Sorting waste items by weight


Pros:
Fast Sorting for Segregation: Efficiently sorts large quantities of waste into categories (e.g., plastics, metals, organics) with average-case time complexity ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ).
Customizability: Can be adapted to sort based on different attributes, such as weight or recyclability(iron or some weighted materials).

Cons:
Potential Inefficiency: Worst-case time complexity of ùëÇ(ùëõ^2) occurs with poorly chosen pivot elements.
Not Stable: The algorithm does not maintain the order of identical items, which might be critical in specific segregation workflows.
May require preprocessing or manual intervention to define sorting criteria for waste types.
